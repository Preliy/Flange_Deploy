# Flange

# 1. Overview
## What is Flange?
**Flange** is a Unity package for the emulation of industrial robots.

## Key Features:
+ Analytical forward and inverse kinematics for different robot types
+ Controller Script: Manages the definition and configuration of robot tools, frames, and mechanical setup
+ Target follower

> [!NOTE]  
> This package does not include motion planning or trajectory generation functionality

# 2. Key Components
**Flange** is built on two primary kinematic components: `Frame.cs` and `Joint.cs`. These scripts work together to define the structure, constraints, and kinematic behavior of the model.

## Frame
![InspectorFrame.PNG](Documentation/Resources/Images/InspectorFrame.PNG)

`Frame.cs` defines a transformation matrix relative to its parent frame, setting local transformation values based on the parent’s coordinate system. 
This approach uses [Modified Denavit–Hartenberg (DH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denavit%E2%80%93Hartenberg_parameters) Parameters for consistent and efficient parameterization of joint positions and orientations within the robotic structure.

## Joint

`Joint.cs` responsible for defining joint constraints and target position values relative to the frame. Each Joint must be paired with a Frame component on the same GameObject, enabling it to adhere to specified limits and target positions within the defined transformation matrix.

## Mechanical Unit

A `MechanicalUnit.cs` combines multiple Frames and Joints into a single assembly, such as an arm or external positioner. It provides essential functionality for configuring and controlling the unit:
+ **Custom Control Panel:** Offers a dedicated interface within the Unity editor to configure and manipulate the unit.
+ **Frame and Joint References:** Ensures that all Frames and Joints within the Mechanical Unit are properly referenced to form a complete kinematic chain.
+ **External Control Access:** Includes public methods to control the unit from external scripts.
+ **Save and Load Configurations:** Public methods to save and load configurations for Frames and Joints, enabling the sharing of kinematic chain parameters across different units.
+ **Kinematic Chain Visualization:** When Gizmos are enabled, a visual representation of the kinematic chain is displayed, aiding in understanding and troubleshooting the mechanical structure.

> [!NOTE]  
> Only serial (open chain) kinematic will supported by default

## Robots

`Robot.cs` serves as an abstract base class for various robotic manipulators within the Flange framework. 
It establishes a abstract methods for implementing forward (FK) and inverse kinematics (IK) specific to different robot types.

+ **Kinematics Implementation**:
Forward and inverse kinematics calculations are defined in derived classes, allowing for flexibility in handling different robotic configurations.

* **Cartesian Limits**:
Defines workspace boundaries for the robot, ensuring that movements stay within safe and reachable zones. 
These limits are essential for _motion planning_ and _trajectory generation_, helping to guide and constrain robotic movements during operation.

### 6R Spherical Wrist
`Robot6RSphericalWrist.cs` represents a 6-axis serial manipulator with a conventional spherical wrist configuration.

### 6R Offset Writs
`Robot6ROffsetWrist.cs` represents a 6-axis manipulator with an offset wrist design, similar to the configuration used by Universal Robots.

### 3D Delta
`Robot3DDelta.cs` represents a 3-axis delta manipulator that uses a parallel kinematics chain, calculated analytically without kinematic coupling. The flange position and the main three-axis positions are calculated first to determine the end effector’s precise location. The rotation of the support links is oriented using `LookAtRotation` quaternion calculations.

### Scara

`RobotScara.cs` represents a 4-axis SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robot.

## Controller

`Controller.cs` serves as the virtual robot controller within the Flange package, orchestrating key calculations and configurations for robot motion and interaction.
+ **Kinematics Management**: Manages forward and inverse kinematics calculations, accounting for the tool, frames, and robot-specific configuration.
+ **External Unit Integration**: References external units and incorporates their positions into the TCP (Tool Center Point) calculations

![Controller.PNG](Documentation%2FResources%2FImages%2FController.PNG)

The `Controller.cs` component features a custom inspector UI, allowing users to control the robot through joint values or by directly moving the TCP. In the Cartesian section of the UI, users can view essential properties such as the current TCP position and rotation, the tool, frame, and robot configuration. Additionally, the configuration selection tool includes a "Select" button, enabling users to browse all possible configurations for a specific pose, with the `Show Turn` option providing further configurations that account for axis turns.

To use the `Tool` and `Frame` properties, tools and frames must first be assigned in the corresponding lists within `Controller.cs`. The Tool and Frame property indices will reference these lists, allowing the user to select specific tools and frames based on their index values.

For kinematic configuration, `Controller.cs` includes three main fields:
+ The **Robot** field, where the robot itself is assigned.
+ The **Base** field, which requires the assignment of a base mechanical unit. This unit acts as the base for the robot, allowing the robot’s reference frame to be moved—for example, along a linear axis.
+ The **External** list, where external mechanical units, such as positioners or rotating tables, can be added to extend the robot’s operational capabilities and coordinate its movements with additional devices.

> [!NOTE]
> If the mechanical configuration is modified, the inspector UI must be reloaded. Reselect the Controller GameObject to see the updated Joints Slider list in the inspector.

> [!NOTE] 
> To activate the TCP handle for manipulation within the Scene View, users must enable the Scene View Controller overlay.

> [!NOTE]  
> The latest asset version was uploaded and the demo scenes were built from Unity 2022.3.0f1 The advertised features relate to the latest version and might not be present in the earlier versions. Please check the documentation changelog.
